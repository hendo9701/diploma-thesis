  Abstract                 = {This article defines C-SPARQL, an extension of SPARQL whose distinguishing feature is the support of continuous queries, i.e. queries registered over RDF data streams and then continuously executed. Queries consider windows, i.e. the most recent triples of such streams, observed while data is continuously flowing. Supporting streams in RDF format guarantees interoperability and opens up important applications, in which reasoners can deal with evolving knowledge over time.
 C-SPARQL is presented by means of a full specification of the syntax, a formal semantics, and a comprehensive set of examples, relative to urban computing applications, that systematically cover the SPARQL extensions. The expression of meaningful queries over streaming data is strictly connected to the availability of aggregation primitives, thus C-SPARQL also includes extensions in this respect.},

  Abstract                 = {With the proliferation of sensors and IoT technologies, stream data are increasingly stored and analyzed, but rarely combined, due to the heterogeneity of sources and technologies. Semantics are increasingly used to share sensory data, but not so much for annotating stream data. Semantic models for stream annotation are scarce, as generally semantics are heavy to process and not ideal for Internet of things (IoT) environments, where the data are frequently updated. We present a light model to semantically annotate streams, IoT-Stream. It takes advantage of common knowledge sharing of the semantics, but keeping the inferences and queries simple. Furthermore, we present a system architecture to demonstrate the adoption the semantic model, and provide examples of instantiation of the system for different use cases. The system architecture is based on commonly used architectures in the field of IoT, such as web services, microservices and middleware. Our system approach includes the semantic annotations that take place in the pipeline of IoT services and sensory data analytics. It includes modules needed to annotate, consume, and query data annotated with IoT-Stream. In addition to this, we present tools that could be used in conjunction to the IoT-Stream model and facilitate the use of semantics in IoT.},

  Abstract                 = {Ontologies have been developed and investigated for some time in artificial intelligence to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse. More recently, the notion of ontologies has attracted attention from fields such as databases, intelligent information integration, cooperative information systems, information retrieval, electronic commerce, enterprise application integration, and knowledge management. This broadened interest in ontologies is based on the feature that they provide a machine-processable semantics of information sources that can be communicated among agents as well as between software artifacts and humans. This feature makes ontologies the backbone technology of the next web generation, i.e., the Semantic Web. Ontologies are currently applied in areas such as knowledge management in large company-wide networks and call centers, and in B2C, B2G, and B2B electronic commerce. In a nutshell, ontologies enable effective and efficient access to heterogeneous and distributed information sources. Given the increasing amount of information available online, this kind of support is becoming more important day by day. The author systematically introduces the notion of ontologies to the non-expert reader and demonstrates in detail how to apply this conceptual framework for improved intranet retrieval of corporate information and knowledge and for enhanced Internet-based electronic commerce. He also describes ontology languages (XML, RDF, and OWL) and ontology tools, and the application of ontologies. In addition to structural improvements, the second edition covers recent developments relating to the Semantic Web, and emerging web-based standard languages.},

A crucial element for the success of these systems is the exchange of information, not only between vehicles, but also among other components in the road infrastructure through different applications. One of the most important information sources in this kind of systems is sensors. Sensors can be within vehicles or as part of the infrastructure, such as bridges, roads or traffic signs. Sensors can provide information related to weather conditions and traffic situation, which is useful to improve the driving process. To facilitate the exchange of information between the different applications that use sensor data, a common framework of knowledge is needed to allow interoperability. In this paper an ontology-driven architecture to improve the driving environment through a traffic sensor network is proposed. The system performs different tasks automatically to increase driver safety and comfort using the information provided by the sensors.},

SOSA is the result of rethinking the W3C-XG Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology based on changes in scope and target audience, technical developments, and lessons learned over the past years. SOSA also acts as a replacement of SSNâ€™s Stimulus Sensor Observation (SSO) core. It has been developed by the ï¬�rst joint working group of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on Spatial Data on the Web. In this work, we motivate the need for SOSA, provide an overview of the main classes and properties, and brieï¬‚y discuss its integration with the new release of the SSN ontology as well as various other alignments to speciï¬�cations such as OGCâ€™s Observations and Measurements (O&M), Dolce-Ultralite (DUL), and other prominent ontologies. We will also touch upon common modeling problems and application areas related to publishing and searching observation, sampling, and actuation data on the Web.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we address the problem of scalable, native and adaptive query processing over Linked Stream Data integrated with Linked Data. Linked Stream Data consists of data generated by stream sources, e.g., sensors, enriched with semantic descriptions, following the standards proposed for Linked Data. This enables the integration of stream data with Linked Data collections and facilitates a wide range of novel applications. Currently available systems use a â€œblack boxâ€� approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as stream/event processing engines and SPARQL query processors by translating to their provided languages. As the experimental results described in this paper show, the need for query translation and data transformation, as well as the lack of full control over the query execution, pose major drawbacks in terms of efficiency. To remedy these drawbacks, we present CQELS (Continuous Query Evaluation over Linked Streams), a native and adaptive query processor for unified query processing over Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In contrast to the existing systems, CQELS uses a â€œwhite boxâ€� approach and implements the required query operators natively to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes. CQELS provides a flexible query execution framework with the query processor dynamically adapting to the changes in the input data. During query execution, it continuously reorders operators according to some heuristics to achieve improved query execution in terms of delay and complexity. Moreover, external disk access on large Linked Data collections is reduced with the use of data encoding and caching of intermediate query results. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, we present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time, under varied query types, dataset sizes, and number of parallel queries. These results show that CQELS outperforms related approaches by orders of magnitude.},

Much of the extensive work on query operators and query processing for data streams has proceeded without the benefit of an answer to this question. While such imprecision may be tolerable when dealing with simple cases, such as flat data, guaranteed physical order and element-wise operations, it can lead to ambiguities when dealing with nested data, disordered streams and windowed operators. We propose reconstitution functions to make the denotation and representation of data streams more precise, and use these functions to investigate the connection between monotonicity and non-blocking behavior of stream operators. We also touch on a reconstitution function for XML data. Other aspects of data stream semantics we consider are the use of punctuation to delineate finite subsets of a stream, adequacy of descriptions of stream disorder, and the formal specification of windowed operators.},

This high-level representation (an ontology) includes topological knowledge and inference rules, in order to compute the next high-level motion an automated vehicle should take, as assistance to a driver. Results on practical cases are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications enable networked devices and services to exchange information and perform actions seamlessly without the need for human intervention. They are viewed as a key enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous applications, like mobile healthcare, telemetry, or intelligent transport systems. We survey existing work on mobile M2M communications, we identify open challenges that have a direct impact on performance and resource usage efficiency, especially the impact on energy efficiency, and we review techniques to improve communications. We review the ETSI standard and application protocols, and draw considerations on the impact of their use in constrained mobile devices. Nowadays, smartphones are equipped with a wide range of embedded sensors, with varied local and wide area connectivity capabilities, and thus they offer a unique opportunity to serve as mobile gateways for other more constrained devices with local connectivity. At the same time, they can gather context data about users and environment from the embedded sensors. These capabilities may be crucial for mobile M2M applications. Finally, in this paper, we consider a scenario where smartphones are used as gateways that collect and aggregate data from sensors in a cellular network. We conclude that, in order for their use to the feasible in terms of a normal depletion time of a smartphoneâ€™s battery, it is a good advice to maximize the collection of data necessary to be transmitted from nearby sensors, and maximize the intervals between transmissions. More research is required to devise energy efficient transmission methods that enable the use of smartphones as mobile gateways.},

  Abstract                 = {La internet de las cosas (en inglÃ©s, Internet of things, abreviado IoT;[1]â€‹ IdC, por sus siglas en espaÃ±ol)[2]â€‹ es un concepto que se refiere a una interconexiÃ³n digital de objetos cotidianos con internet.[3]â€‹[4]â€‹ Es, en definitiva, la conexión de internet más con objetos que con personas.[2]â€‹ TambiÃ©n se suele conocer como internet de todas las cosas o internet en las cosas. Si los objetos de la vida cotidiana tuvieran incorporadas etiquetas de radio, podrÃ­an ser identificados y gestionados por otros equipos de la misma manera que si lo fuesen por seres humanos.[5]â€‹[6]â€‹
Constituye un cambio radical en la calidad de vida de las personas en la sociedad, ofrece una gran cantidad de nuevas oportunidades de acceso a datos, servicios especÃ­ficos en la educaciÃ³n, seguridad, asistencia sanitaria y en el transporte, entre otros campos.
El concepto de internet de las cosas fue propuesto en 1999, por Kevin Ashton, en el Auto-ID Center del MIT,[7]â€‹ en donde se realizaban investigaciones en el campo de la identificaciÃ³n por radiofrecuencia en red (RFID) y tecnologÃ­as de sensores.[8]â€‹
Por ejemplo, si los libros, termostatos, refrigeradores, la paqueterÃ­a, lÃ¡mparas, botiquines, partes automotrices, entre otros, estuvieran conectados a internet y equipados con dispositivos de identificaciÃ³n, no existirÃ­an, en teorÃ­a, artÃ­culos fuera de stock o medicinas caducas; sabrÃ­amos exactamente la ubicaciÃ³n, cÃ³mo se consumen en el mundo; el extravÃ­o pasarÃ­a a ser cosa del pasado, y sabrÃ­amos quÃ© estÃ¡ encendido y quÃ© estÃ¡ apagado en todo momento.[9]â€‹
Se calcula que todo ser humano estÃ¡ rodeado, al menos, por un total de aproximadamente 1000 a 5000 objetos.[10]â€‹[11]â€‹ Por un lado, segÃºn la empresa Gartner, en 2020[12]â€‹ habrÃ¡ en el mundo aproximadamente 26 mil millones de dispositivos con un sistema de conexiÃ³n al internet de las cosas.[13]â€‹ Abi Research, por otro lado, afirma que para el mismo aÃ±o existirÃ¡n 30 mil millones de dispositivos inalÃ¡mbricos conectados a internet.[14]â€‹ Con la prÃ³xima generaciÃ³n de aplicaciones de internet (protocolo IPv6) se podrÃ­an identificar todos los objetos, algo que no se podÃ­a hacer con IPv4. Este sistema serÃ­a capaz de identificar instantÃ¡neamente por medio de un cÃ³digo a cualquier tipo de objeto.[15]â€‹
La empresa estadounidense Cisco, que es quien estÃ¡ detrÃ¡s de la iniciativa de la internet de las cosas, ha creado un â€œcontador de conexionesâ€� dinÃ¡mico que le permite estimar el nÃºmero de â€œcosasâ€� conectadas desde julio del 2013 hasta 2020.[16]â€‹
La conexiÃ³n de dispositivos a la red a travÃ©s de seÃ±ales de radio de baja potencia es el campo de estudio mÃ¡s activo de la internet de las cosas. Este hecho explica por quÃ© las seÃ±ales de este tipo no necesitan wi-fi ni bluetooth. Sin embargo, se estÃ¡n investigando distintas alternativas que necesitan menos energÃ­a y que resultan mÃ¡s econÃ³micas, con el nombre Chirp Networks.[17]â€‹[18]â€‹
A la fecha de este artÃ­culo, el tÃ©rmino internet de las cosas se usa con una denotaciÃ³n de conexiÃ³n avanzada de dispositivos, sistemas y servicios que va mÃ¡s allÃ¡ del tradicional M2M (mÃ¡quina a mÃ¡quina) y abarca una amplia variedad de protocolos, dominios y aplicaciones. [17]â€‹[19]â€‹
El servicio touchatag de Alcatel-Lucent y el gadget Violeta Mirror pueden proporcionar un enfoque de orientaciÃ³n pragmÃ¡tica a los consumidores de la internet de las cosas, por el que cualquiera puede enlazar elementos del mundo real al mundo en lÃ­nea utilizando las etiquetas RFID (y cÃ³digos QR, en el caso de touchatag).},
